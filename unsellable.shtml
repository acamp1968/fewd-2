				    <p><span class="image right"><img src="images/Thimbleberry.jpg" alt="House in Foreclosure" /></span>Properties that are on the market but not selling may also be accepted. Many other reasons may be those such as an undesirable location, unrealistic price, bad odors, lack of natural light, poor architecture rending a home unchangeable, mold or environmental problems are a few of the possible reasons.</p>
